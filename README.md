## Advent of Code 2023

Notable things this year:

* I tried Rust a bit more and really like it! Feels as powerful as Python, maybe a bit more verbose, but much less struggle than with Go.
* I went quite deep with part 2 of day 8, which wasn't actually necessary since the input was aligned in a way permitting a simpler solution. I noticed it mid-way, but finished the full solution anyway.
* My solution for day 10 is a single and quite simple linear pass for each part, while others seem to have deployed various search algos. Curious.
* I did a bunch of premature optimization for day 12 and it ended up buggy. Rewrote with a simple solution, which ended up fast enough.

Same as last year:

* Not all of the code I write here I can be proud of. As last year, sometimes I try a new language, and sometimes I'm short on time that day.
* Some problems are mostly math or logic, not programming. Nice, keep it up!
